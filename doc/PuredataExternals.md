# Work with Pd externals

TODOC : gdx-pd is based on pd vanilla which includes only vanilla externals (expr, bonk, sigmund, ...)

TODOC : add some externals (your own or others), using deken ?

TODOC : rebuild natives and whole library with docker (modify project version to identify your build/fork)
